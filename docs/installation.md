# Installation

## Step 1 - Install application

`git clone https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do.git` into the document root of a local web server.

## Step 2 - Install event store adapter

prooph offers two database adapters for `prooph/event-store` (at the moment).
Pick the one you want to play with and install it via composer.

### Doctrine DBAL Adapter

`composer require prooph/event-store-doctrine-adapter`

### MongoDB Adapter

`composer require prooph/event-store-mongodb-adapter`

## Step 3 - Configure Database

Before you can start you have to configure your database connection.
As this is an example application for a CQRS-driven application we are using two different persistence layers.
One is responsible for persisting the **write model**. This task is taken by prooph/event-store.
And the other one is responsible for persisting the **read model** aka **projections**.

We've prepared a template for you. Just rename the
[config/dbal_connection.local.php.dist](../config/dbal_connection.local.php.dist) to `dbal_connection.local.php` and adjust configuration accordingly.
Read on for more details.

### Adapter Configuration

Tell the event store which adapter to use. To do so rename [config/event_store.local.php.dist](../config/event_store.local.php.dist) to `config/event_store.local.php`
and uncomment the adapter that you have installed in **Step 2**.

#### Doctrine DBAL Adapter

If you uncomment the doctrine dbal adapter it will use the same **dbal connection** as the read model does.
The required `event_stream` table is automatically created by `doctrine migrations` which you have to execute to create
the projection tables too. Please see projection configuration for details.

#### MongoDB Adapter

If you uncomment the mongo db adapter you also need to rename [config/mongo_client.local.php.dist](../config/mongo_client.local.php.dist) to `config/mongo_client.local.php`.
The MongoDB adapter will use a `\MongoClient` with default connection settings.
But you can adjust the mongo client set up in the config file linked above.

### Projection Configuration
Projections are persisted in SQL tables using Doctrine DBAL. The projections are independent from the event store adapter
so you must set up a RDBMS (we suggest MySql) and adjust the `doctrine.connection.default` configuration
which you can find in the `dbal_connection.local.php.dist` file.

#### Create An Empty Database
Before you can run the migrations you have to make sure that the database `todo` exists. You can of course use another
name for the database but please align the `doctrine.connection.default` configuration accordingly.

#### Run Doctrine Migrations

To create the needed projection tables (and the `event_stream` if the doctrine event store adapter is installed)
you should perform the [migrations](../migrations/) by running `php bin/migrations.php migrations:migrate` from the project root.

*Note: We use a custom migrations script instead of the doctrine version because we're injecting the dbal connection provided by our IoC container.*

## Step 4 - View It

Open a terminal and navigate to the project root. Then start the PHP built-in web server with `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public`
and open `http://localhost:8080/proophessor-do` in a browser.

*Note: You can also set the environmental variable `PROOPH_ENV` to `development`. That will forward exception messages to the client in cause of an error.
When using the built-in web server you can set the variable like so: `PROOPH_ENV=development php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public`*
